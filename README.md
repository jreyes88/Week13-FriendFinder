# Week13-FriendFinder
My version of the Friend Finder assignment is called Margaritaville Matcher. It's like a Buzzfeed Quiz/Personality Matcher Hybrid. It's Jimmy Buffett-themed, specifically based on his song "If You Like Pi√±a Coladas."

The user answers each prompt by selecting a number between 1 (Strongly Disagree) and 5 (Strongly Agree) and it will use the user's input to pair them with a yacht rock artist.
